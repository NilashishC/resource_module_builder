short_description: LACP interfaces resource module
description: This module manages Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) attributes
  of NX-OS Interfaces.
version_added: 1.0.0
author: Trishna Guha (@trishnaguha)
notes:
- Tested against NXOS 7.3.(0)D1(1) on VIRL
options:
  running_config:
    description:
    - This option is used only with state I(parsed).
    - The value of this option should be the output received from the NX-OS device
      by executing the command B(show running-config | section ^interface).
    - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and
      transforms it into Ansible structured data as per the resource module's argspec
      and the value is then returned in the I(parsed) key within the result.
    type: str
  config:
    description: A dictionary of LACP interfaces options.
    type: list
    elements: dict
    suboptions:
      name:
        description:
        - Name of the interface.
        required: true
        type: str
      port_priority:
        description:
        - LACP port priority for the interface. Range 1-65535. Applicable only for
          Ethernet.
        type: int
      rate:
        description:
        - Rate at which PDUs are sent by LACP. Applicable only for Ethernet. At fast
          rate LACP is transmitted once every 1 second. At normal rate LACP is transmitted
          every 30 seconds after the link is bundled.
        type: str
        choices:
        - fast
        - normal
      links:
        description:
        - This dict contains configurable options related to max and min port-channel
          links. Applicable only for Port-channel.
        type: dict
        suboptions:
          max:
            description:
            - Port-channel max bundle.
            type: int
          min:
            description:
            - Port-channel min links.
            type: int
      mode:
        description:
        - LACP mode. Applicable only for Port-channel.
        type: str
        choices:
        - delay
      suspend_individual:
        description:
        - port-channel lacp state. Disabling this will cause lacp to put the port
          to individual state and not suspend the port in case it does not get LACP
          BPDU from the peer ports in the port-channel.
        type: bool
      convergence:
        description:
        - This dict contains configurable options related to convergence. Applicable
          only for Port-channel.
        type: dict
        suboptions:
          graceful:
            description:
            - port-channel lacp graceful convergence. Disable this only with lacp
              ports connected to Non-Nexus peer. Disabling this with Nexus peer can
              lead to port suspension.
            type: bool
          vpc:
            description:
            - Enable lacp convergence for vPC port channels.
